My Ph.D. [thesis](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/151500) was centered around DNA topology following two axis: 1) a polymer physics perspective where I imaged DNA by AFM and used it as a model to study topological effects in polymer physics, and 2) a biophysical perspective where I studied mainly through numerical simulations the the biological consequences of topological effects like supercoiling and knotting.

During my postdoc at Harvard University, I used fluorescence microscopy to study the structure and dynamics of the E.coli nucleoid. By acquiring images of the nucleoid tagged with a GFP-fusion of a DNA binding protein (HupA) at several focal planes, one can reconstruct its 3D shape. Additionally, the origin of replication was also tagged, allowing to study the relation between the dynamics of a single locus and the global chromosome dynamics. See [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867413004054?via%3Dihub) for more details.

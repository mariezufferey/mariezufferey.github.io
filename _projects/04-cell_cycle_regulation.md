My current project funded by an SNF Ambizione fellowship is centered around the bacterial cell cycle. In order to achieve robust growth in various conditions, bacteria need to coordinate their division and DNA replication cycles. A powerful way to get insight into that coordination and to infer conceptual regulatory strategies is to observe specific events related to each cycle in complete cell cycles of living bacteria. I achieve this by growing *E.coli* in microfluidics devices and using phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy to track these events. The movie below shows an example of the type of microscopy data that I am acquiring. Cells can be seen in dark blue, growing in horizontal microfluidic channels. The origin of replication is tagged and appears as red dots. The division machinery is made visible through the tagging of the FtsZ protein in green. I designed software to detect and track those elements automatically in each cell. For example the tracking of the red dots (origin of replication) and the detection of the moment where those split into two, allows to identify a replication initiation event.

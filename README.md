This is the code used to power the personnal website of Guillaume Witz. It is powered by Jekyll nad hosted on Github pages.
The theme is derived from a version of [jekyll-skeleton](https://github.com/awochna/jekyll-skeleton/) (Â© 2016 Alex Wynter) made by Thomas Julou.

## Notes regarding the implementation

- Despite the temptation of fancy available themes, I decided to stick to the [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) boilerplate for its minimalism. I followed the recommandation of designing for mobile first and to add media queries for wider screens when necessary.

- tried to control whitespace of liquid tags using [hyphenised tags](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/whitespace/).

- In order to be hosted on Github Pages, no user-contributed plugins are allowed. In particular, instead of relying on jekyll-scholar to generate biobliography, I decided to include a slightly modified version of HTML files generated by Zotero (with includes COinS tags for free :).

- used youtubve for videos and diabled branding and content suggestion as much as possible. NB: you can change the license of your youtube video to a creative commons one.
